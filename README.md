## Comments
* performance of _Sorted Search_ algorithm could be improved by implementing a binary search
  but I felt there was not sufficient time to do this
* read requirements for _Decorator Stream_ question were a bit unclear
* _Two Sum_ answer fails the performance test.
  _FindTwoSum2_ is an [alternative implementation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36506164/find-two-sum-function-in-c-sharp) which does not.
* _Platformer_ answer fails the performance test for large platforms.  This probably due to removing items from a List`.
_Platformer2_ is another implementation which will probably pass the performance test.
* If you're doing the test for real, make sure you have a real IDE eg Visual Studio,
  to hand.  The web IDE is only really/barely suitable for the sample questions.
  It doesn't have a debugger, IntelliSense, refactoring or any other productivity features.

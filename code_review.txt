'periodName is an unused variable
typo in GetStartt(); should be named 'GetStart()'
unclear if DateTimes are being stored in UTC
DateTime equals should really be done within a tolerance
GetNextPeriod() overloads are confusing
  GetNextPeriod(int) is unclear that it applies from current time
GetNextPeriod(DateTime) makes no check that nextEnd is past start
DateTime.Now is dependent on server location, should really use DateTime.UtcNow
GetNextPeriod(int) makes no range checks ie allows negative/large numbers
